# MPNet: A lightweight fault diagnosis network for rotating machinery 
Aiming at the real-time accurate detection of typical rotating machinery faults in the practical strong noise industrial scenarios, we propose a sound signal-based rotating machinery fault diagnosis method, and designs a novel lightweight fault diagnosis network called MPNet, which well balances accuracy, real-time performance and model size.
Detailed data will be available soon!
